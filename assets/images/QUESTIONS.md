## Why do we need docker? Why now?

- `Problem of isolation`: We can run different version of same app in different container.
- `Problem of environments`: The number of different types of environments was increasing, need to test the app in all sorts of environments, app might work in one environment but breaks in another. This was solved by docker by introducing the concept of containers and images. Wherever the container is runing, it will be running with same exact dependencies it was built with.
- `Problem of speed`: Speed of business, for delivering apps and ideas.
