## Docker compose

- Allows us to configure relationships between containers
- For example attaching a SQL container withy nodejs container to make a backend server
- Easy to read setup for running containers
- We can write docker compose file in a yaml file
- You can specify containers, networks, volumes in the yaml file
- We can use a CLI tool called docker-compose to run those docker compose yaml files.

## Commands

- docker compose up (This will build and run the containers)
- docker compose down (This will stop the containers)
