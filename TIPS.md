# Tips

- To build a container Image, we need to use a Dockerfile. 
- The `docker build` command uses the Dockerfile to build a new container image.
- Docker file is like a recipe/set of instructions that is responsible for making a container-image/docker-image
- docker build command will build the docker-image, based on the instructions given in the DOCKERFILE
- One image can have multiple containers
- Each container has independent file system
- use this website to learn docker => https://labs.play-with-docker.com
- `docker run` command will run the `docker pull` command and pull the image for you if it does not exist already.
- We can run docker containers locally by using Docker Desktop, on server we can run them by using Docker engine or K8's, 
- OCI (Open Container Initiative) => It is like standard set of instructions set for containers and images. Wherever the containers are made they have a standard interface through OCI.







- Use nginx:alpine where he does => `docker container run <stuff> ngin`
